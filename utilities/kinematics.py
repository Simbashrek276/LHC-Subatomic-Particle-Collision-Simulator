"""Relativistic kinematics toolkit. Based on section 2.5 of the report.

This is the physics engine. It knows nothing about photons or protons by name.
It only works with numbers, the masses in TeV and the four vectors. simulation.py
owns the particle names and calls in here to build the actual energies and momenta.

The main idea is that any final state can be built by splitting things two at a
time. A group of particles is treated as one made up "composite" particle with
its own invariant mass. We split the event into two of those, then split each of
those into its pieces. Every split is a simple two body decay done in the
parent's rest frame, then boosted into the lab.

Read the file in this order.
    1. P4 and its mass
    2. two_body_decay and boost, the two building blocks
    3. draw_composite_mass, picking a composite's mass
    4. two_to_two, two_to_three, two_to_four, putting the blocks together
    5. generate_momenta, the one function simulation.py calls

This is the full 3D version: momentum now has three spatial components
(px, py, pz) instead of two. Random directions are drawn isotropically over the
sphere instead of uniformly over a circle, and the boost is the general 3D
Lorentz boost matrix rather than the 2D special case.
